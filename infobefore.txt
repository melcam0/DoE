Install the DoE and R-Portable program (required for DoE to work).
All necessary libraries are installed.
The program is installed in C: / DoE (highly recommended option!).


To uninstall the program, click on "Uninstall DoE" in the DoE menu or run unis000.exe directly from the C: / DoE folder (manually delete any residual files and the DoE folder)
